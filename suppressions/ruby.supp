  On platforms where memcpy is safe for overlapped memory, the compiler will sometimes replace memmove with memcpy. Valgrind may report a false positive.

  Requiring a file will add it to the loaded features, which may be reported as a leak.

  recursive_list_access creates a hash called `list` that is stored on the threadptr_recursive_hash. This is reported as a memory leak.

  strscan_do_scan in strscan.c will sometimes replace the ptr of the regex, which can be reported as a memory leak if the regex is stored in an iseq. https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/8136

  The callcache table (RCLASS_CC_TBL) is lazily created, so it is allocated when the first method that gets cached. If this happens in a native extension, it may be reported as a memory leak.

  The date library lazily initializes Regexps using static local variables through the function `regcomp`. The Regexp will end up being reported as a memory leak.
